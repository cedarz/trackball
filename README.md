## Overview

Trackball is a standalone C++ interactor for lightweight 3D programs.<br>
A TrackBall (aka ArcBall) orbits about an arbitrary world coordinate, although
this implementation also allows first-person pitch and yaw if desired.
A right-hand ZYX system is used, but can be easily ported to a left-hand system.

## Features
- Intuitive "lookAt" camera model with focal center point, eye and up vectors.
- Map three mouse buttons to either orbit, dolly (zoom), pan, first-person or roll.
- Map scroll to dolly (zoom) or roll.
- Adjust speed of all motions, such as with meta keys shift/ctrl/alt.
- Depends only on the GLM library.
- Cross-platform example with OpenGL and GLFW.

## Example

### Build

    $ mkdir -p build &&                                                  \
      cd build &&                                                        \
      cmake -DGLFW_INCLUDE_DIR:PATH=/usr/local/glfw-3.1.2/include        \
            -DGLFW_LIBRARY:FILEPATH=/usr/local/glfw-3.1.2/lib/libglfw.so \
            -DGLM_INCLUDE_DIR:PATH=/usr/local/glm-0.9.7.4/include        \
            -DCMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE:BOOL=ON                             \
            .. &&                                                        \
      make

### Run

    $ ./examples/glfw/example
